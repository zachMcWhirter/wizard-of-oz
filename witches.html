    <p>The Good Witch of the South is Glinda the Good. She is the most powerful of the Witches. According
        to the Soldier with Green
        Whiskers, Glinda:</p>
    <blockquote> "knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived."" â€” The Wonderful
        Wizard of Oz, chapter 18, "Away to the
        South"</blockquote>
    <p>So she was the most beautiful of the four witches. Later books in Baum's Oz series refer to Glinda
        as a Sorceress, rather
        than a Witch.</p>
